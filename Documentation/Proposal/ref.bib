	abstract = {Multimedia programming environments are intuitive and easy to use for even the non-programmer. However, the textual scripting languages of these environments are difficult to use and require programming experience to code significant functionality. We pro pose a visual scripting language to help bridge the usability gap between the multimedia programming environment and its scripting language by cognitively simplifying the scripting task. Visual programming languages can be easier and faster to program in than textual languages, and visual code can be easier to understand. We explore our hypothesis by designing a multimedia programming environment with a visual scripting language.},

	abstract = {A new method is proposed for clustering XML documents by structure-constrained phrases. It is implemented by three machine-learning approaches previously unexplored in the XML domain, namely non-negative matrix (tri-)factorization, co-clustering and automatic transactional clustering. A novel class of XML features approximately captures structure-constrained phrases as n-grams contextualized by root-to-leaf paths. Experiments over real-world benchmark XML corpora show that the effectiveness of the three approaches improves with contextualized n-grams of suitable length. This confirms the validity of the devised method from multiple clustering perspectives. Two approaches overcome in effectiveness several state-of-the-art competitors. The scalability of the three approaches is investigated, too.},
