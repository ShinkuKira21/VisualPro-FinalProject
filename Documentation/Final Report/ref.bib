	abstract = {One of the first textbooks to be fully up-to-date with the new and expanded UML 2.0 standard, this is an ideal introduction to the Unified Modelling Language for students learning about object and component-based software design and development.  The book encourages a pragmatic and open-minded approach to real-life software engineering. It places UML in the context of the software engineering discipline as a whole, providing students with a practical understanding of best practice in software design and development.  The authors present a broad view of the subject area, enabling students to see for themselves how different practices may be appropriate for different situations. The book is divided into four parts covering:Part 1 - Introductory ConceptsPart 2 - UML, the language Part 3 - Case studies Part 4 - Applying UML in practice.},

	abstract = {The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is becoming the de facto standard for software analysis and design modeling. However, there is still significant resistance to model-driven development in many software organizations because it is perceived to be expensive and not necessarily cost-effective. Hence, it is important to investigate the benefits obtained from modeling. As a first step in this direction, this paper reports on controlled experiments, spanning two locations, that investigate the impact of UML documentation on software maintenance. Results show that, for complex tasks and past a certain learning curve, the availability of UML documentation may result in significant improvements in the functional correctness of changes as well as the quality of their design. However, there does not seem to be any saving of time. For simpler tasks, the time needed to update the UML documentation may be substantial compared with the potential benefits, thus motivating the need for UML tools with better support for software maintenance.

	abstract = {A new method is proposed for clustering XML documents by structure-constrained phrases. It is implemented by three machine-learning approaches previously unexplored in the XML domain, namely non-negative matrix (tri-)factorization, co-clustering and automatic transactional clustering. A novel class of XML features approximately captures structure-constrained phrases as n-grams contextualized by root-to-leaf paths. Experiments over real-world benchmark XML corpora show that the effectiveness of the three approaches improves with contextualized n-grams of suitable length. This confirms the validity of the devised method from multiple clustering perspectives. Two approaches overcome in effectiveness several state-of-the-art competitors. The scalability of the three approaches is investigated, too.},
