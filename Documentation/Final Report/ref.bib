	abstract = {Multimedia programming environments are intuitive and easy to use for even the non-programmer. However, the textual scripting languages of these environments are difficult to use and require programming experience to code significant functionality. We pro pose a visual scripting language to help bridge the usability gap between the multimedia programming environment and its scripting language by cognitively simplifying the scripting task. Visual programming languages can be easier and faster to program in than textual languages, and visual code can be easier to understand. We explore our hypothesis by designing a multimedia programming environment with a visual scripting language.},

It is implemented by three machine-learning approaches previously unexplored in the XML domain, namely non-negative matrix (tri-)factorization, co-clustering and automatic transactional clustering. A novel class of XML features approximately captures structure-constrained phrases as n-grams contextualized by root-to-leaf paths. Experiments over real-world benchmark XML corpora show that the effectiveness of the three approaches improves with contextualized n-grams of suitable length. This confirms the validity of the devised method from multiple clustering perspectives. Two approaches overcome in effectiveness several state-of-the-art competitors. The scalability of the three approaches is investigated, too.},

	abstract = {The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is becoming the de facto standard for software analysis and design modeling. However, there is still significant resistance to model-driven development in many software organizations because it is perceived to be expensive and not necessarily cost-effective. Hence, it is important to investigate the benefits obtained from modeling. As a first step in this direction, this paper reports on controlled experiments, spanning two locations, that investigate the impact of UML documentation on software maintenance. Results show that, for complex tasks and past a certain learning curve, the availability of UML documentation may result in significant improvements in the functional correctness of changes as well as the quality of their design. However, there does not seem to be any saving of time. For simpler tasks, the time needed to update the UML documentation may be substantial compared with the potential benefits, thus motivating the need for UML tools with better support for software maintenance.

The next phase of telecommunications is a major power shift that will fall into a category called personalization, and will be marked by a virtual explosion of innovation. The first of the new personal communications devices BNR envisages is Orbitor, a pocket-sized, mobile communications product concept that integrates voice, messaging, and graphical capabilities. Because Orbitor is a window on a system - revealing everything that system has to offer in ways that are idiosyncratic to the user - it will satisfy the fundamental user values of profound simplicity, conspicuous value, self-evidence, access, real-time interaction, mobility, and control. Personalization is a category that will also become synonymous with personal decisions and personal choices.},

Generally, at the end of the development phase, there is not enough time or money left to enhance the usability of software. After the user interface has been developed, the users are left alone to handle any problems with the interface. Systematic development using engineering processes can help to overcome these usability problems. This article introduces a structured Useware engineering process, the application of which enhances user orientation which leads to higher acceptance and more practical user interfaces. The article finds that the current process is supported by various expert development tools for the production of user interfaces; these tools ensure a systematic and continuous data transferability from one phase to the next. The process has already provided remarkable results in the area of task orientation and usability within several different industrial sectors, e.g. medicine, manufacturing industry and process engineering. Further possibilities to apply this process are software for online catalog planning or lending and return machines.},

Although a few seminal ideas and instruments have been available for assessing qualities of qualitative research, they have either remained the same or have made little progress. There are several ongoing issues regarding the evaluation of qualitative research, including (1) the fact that there is little agreement on the nature of evaluation in qualitative research, (2) the continuous impact of traditional positivist evaluation criteria on qualitative research, and (3) the broad political discourse on the politics of evidence. This chapter presents a series of definitions regarding evaluation, quality, standards, and excellence, and it discusses major evaluation concepts.},

This paper proposed an approach that considers the interactive systems generation process as a usability optimization problem by the model-driven engineering approach. The aims was to generate all possible concrete user interfaces from a given abstract user interface. Then, the usability optimization process selects the optimal concrete user interface for a specific context of use.},

Student evaluations of the tutorials have been quite favorable. The framework of the tutorial is such that it works well for a wide variety of applications and disciplines. Development of new tutorials is therefore fast and easy, and requires only a rudimentary knowledge of HTML.

	abstract = {Personalized computer-based tutoring demands learning systems and applications that identify and keep personal characteristics and features for each individual learner. This is achieved by the technology of student modeling. One prevalent technique of student modeling is stereotypes. Furthermore, individuals differ in how they learn. So, the way that helps an individual to learn best is crucial for offering her/him an effective tutoring experience. As a consequence, students' preferable styles of learning should be incorporated into the student model. However, some researchers have concluded that there are individuals that have a mixture of learning styles. That is the reason for the combination of two different learning style models in the presented approach. Particularly, in this paper we present a stereotype student model that combines the Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing and Kinesthetic (VARK) learning style model and the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI). The aim of this article is to further enhance the personalization to students' needs and preferences by introducing this hybrid instrument and using the technology of stereotypes. The gain from this hybrid learning style approach is that we model two different dimensions of the way that a student prefers to learn: i) the sensory modalities of learning and ii) the way of thinking. In this way, the offered tutoring process can be more tailored to each individual student's needs, respecting the distinct pace of her/his learning. Our novel approach has been incorporated in an e-learning system and was evaluated by 60 undergraduate students in Greece. The evaluation results show a great acceptance rate of the novel hybrid learning style model by students and underline its pedagogical potential.},

However, the previous studies on adaptive learning systems set a high entry barrier for researchers who lack programming skills, and few of the studies involved authentic everyday learning materials. This author proposes to test the feasibility of eye-tracking technology in identifying learning styles with everyday materials, as well as the identification accuracy. This author selected the Felder-Silverman's learning style model (FSLSM) as the framework, enlisted the behaviour patterns that can be used to identify the eight learning styles in the FSLSM model, and conducted a quasi-experiment to test whether these behaviour patterns apply to eye movement differences. Then, this author compared the results of eye-tracking identification with participants' self-report based on Index of Learning Style (ILS) questionnaire for identification accuracy. This quasi-experiment recruited 30 university students, including 19 female and 11 male. Findings showed that eye-tracking technology has the potential to quickly identify learners of different types categorised by the FSLSM theory, with accuracy ranging from 63.50\% to 84.67\%; however, there are disturbing factors contributing to different levels of identification accuracy, which should be investigated in future research.},

However, due to the limited availability of human labeled training data, training data that stay in the same feature space or have the same distribution as the future data cannot be guaranteed to be sufficient enough to avoid the over-fitting problem. In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in visual categorization applications, such as object recognition, image classification, and human action recognition.},
