System testing is the last phase of testing that done by the developer in the internal work- space. However, phase of testing is not the end of the whole testing phase, since there is another stage to pass before the product deployment process, it is the acceptance testing. A popular method to perform the user acceptance testing is the usability testing, which in this method, the result provides the indication of the essential quality for the client to decide whether to approve or to deny the product. In this research of paper, we are going to do the usability testing by utilizing the System Usability Scale technique and the Net Promoter Score technique to measure appropriateness of the population information systems in the city of Tegal while we are also finding optimum testers required using the sampling technique. The result we earn trough this research is according to the Usability Testing result the proposed system developed by researchers is better than the current running system and the total testers participating on system testing is able to optimize using the sampling method.},

	abstract = {Usability is a critical aspect of software systems because poor user experience can lead users to choose other software. One way to improve usability is through testing. But, usability testing is a challenge because, most of the times, it can not be accomplished without the presence of real users, which is complex and requires a lot of effort. However, there are some aspects and usability guidelines that can be tested automatically. This paper presents a test approach that defines generic test strategies (test patterns) to test usability guidelines (or best practices). It is an extension to previous work on testing functional aspects of web applications through the {GUI} ({PBGT} – Pattern Based {GUI} Testing). The main goal of this work is to be the first step in extending {PBGT}'s {PARADIGM} language with usability testing patterns, so that it is possible to build test models from which usability tests can be generated and automatically executed over a website. This paper presents a new usability test pattern, called "Reachability Test Pattern", which is validated in a case study performed over an academic software system available on the web.},

	abstract = {Voice user interfaces ({VUI}) have been increasingly used in everyday settings and they are growing in popularity. These interfaces have predominantly eyes-free and hands-free interactions. This kind of experiences continues to be an inceptive field compared to other input methods such as touch or using the keyboard/mouse. Thus, it is important to identify tools used to evaluate the usability of {VUIs}. This article presents a systematic review, in which we analyzed 57 articles and describes nine questionnaires used for evaluating the usability of {VUIs}, assessing the potential suitability of these questionnaires to measure different types of interactions and various usability dimensions. We found that these questionnaires were used to evaluate the usability of voice-only and voice-added {VUIs}: {AttrakDiff}, {ICF}-{US}, {MOS}-X, {SUISQ}-R, {SUS}, {SASSI}, {UEQ}, {PARADISE} and {USE}, where the {SUS} questionnaire is the most commonly used. However, its items do not directly assess voice quality, although it evaluates the general user interaction with a system. All the questionnaires include items related to three usability dimensions (effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction). The questionnaire with the most homogeneous coverage regarding the number of items in each aspect of usability is the {SASSI} questionnaire. It is a normal practice to use multiple questionnaires to obtain a more complete measurement of usability. We perceive the necessity to increase usability research about the differences between the voice interaction with diverse display types (voice-first, voice-only, voice-added) and the dialog types (command-based and conversational), and how usability affects the user expectations about the {VUIs}.},

The quantitative evaluation of qualitative concepts such as usability has been always associated with many challenges. In this paper, a fuzzy expert system has been developed for quantitative evaluation of usability and also increasing the detection of problems and deficiencies in interface design.

Our findings are that the probability that code without initial tests will ever get covered by unit tests is very low. Only the existence of unit tests ensures testability of the code under test. Besides finding defects unit tests also ensure modular design, which is the base for reuse, maintainability and testability. As a consequence, code and tests should be written together, ideally in a test-driven way.},

	abstract = {Personalized computer-based tutoring demands learning systems and applications that identify and keep personal characteristics and features for each individual learner. This is achieved by the technology of student modeling. One prevalent technique of student modeling is stereotypes. Furthermore, individuals differ in how they learn. So, the way that helps an individual to learn best is crucial for offering her/him an effective tutoring experience. As a consequence, students' preferable styles of learning should be incorporated into the student model. However, some researchers have concluded that there are individuals that have a mixture of learning styles. That is the reason for the combination of two different learning style models in the presented approach. Particularly, in this paper we present a stereotype student model that combines the Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing and Kinesthetic ({VARK}) learning style model and the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument ({HBDI}). The aim of this article is to further enhance the personalization to students' needs and preferences by introducing this hybrid instrument and using the technology of stereotypes. The gain from this hybrid learning style approach is that we model two different dimensions of the way that a student prefers to learn: i) the sensory modalities of learning and ii) the way of thinking. In this way, the offered tutoring process can be more tailored to each individual student's needs, respecting the distinct pace of her/his learning. Our novel approach has been incorporated in an e-learning system and was evaluated by 60 undergraduate students in Greece. The evaluation results show a great acceptance rate of the novel hybrid learning style model by students and underline its pedagogical potential.},

This author selected the Felder-Silverman's learning style model ({FSLSM}) as the framework, enlisted the behaviour patterns that can be used to identify the eight learning styles in the {FSLSM} model, and conducted a quasi-experiment to test whether these behaviour patterns apply to eye movement differences. Then, this author compared the results of eye-tracking identification with participants' self-report based on Index of Learning Style ({ILS}) questionnaire for identification accuracy. This quasi-experiment recruited 30 university students, including 19 female and 11 male. Findings showed that eye-tracking technology has the potential to quickly identify learners of different types categorised by the {FSLSM} theory, with accuracy ranging from 63.50\% to 84.67\%; however, there are disturbing factors contributing to different levels of identification accuracy, which should be investigated in future research.},

In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved.

	abstract = {The development time for user interfaces is drastically reduced by today's shorter product life cycles. Generally, at the end of the development phase, there is not enough time or money left to enhance the usability of software. After the user interface has been developed, the users are left alone to handle any problems with the interface. Systematic development using engineering processes can help to overcome these usability problems. This article introduces a structured Useware engineering process, the application of which enhances user orientation which leads to higher acceptance and more practical user interfaces. The article finds that the current process is supported by various expert development tools for the production of user interfaces; these tools ensure a systematic and continuous data transferability from one phase to the next. The process has already provided remarkable results in the area of task orientation and usability within several different industrial sectors, e.g. medicine, manufacturing industry and process engineering. Further possibilities to apply this process are software for online catalog planning or lending and return machines.},

A metastudy is presented which considers some 1,937 research papers measuring user preference and performance in system studies.

The first of the new personal communications devices {BNR} envisages is Orbitor, a pocket-sized, mobile communications product concept that integrates voice, messaging, and graphical capabilities. Because Orbitor is a window on a system - revealing everything that system has to offer in ways that are idiosyncratic to the user - it will satisfy the fundamental user values of profound simplicity, conspicuous value, self-evidence, access, real-time interaction, mobility, and control. Personalization is a category that will also become synonymous with personal decisions and personal choices.},

	abstract = {The Unified Modeling Language ({UML}) is becoming the de facto standard for software analysis and design modeling. However, there is still significant resistance to model-driven development in many software organizations because it is perceived to be expensive and not necessarily cost-effective. Hence, it is important to investigate the benefits obtained from modeling. As a first step in this direction, this paper reports on controlled experiments, spanning two locations, that investigate the impact of {UML} documentation on software maintenance. Results show that, for complex tasks and past a certain learning curve, the availability of {UML} documentation may result in significant improvements in the functional correctness of changes as well as the quality of their design. However, there does not seem to be any saving of time. For simpler tasks, the time needed to update the {UML} documentation may be substantial compared with the potential benefits, thus motivating the need for {UML} tools with better support for software maintenance.

A novel class of {XML} features approximately captures structure-constrained phrases as n-grams contextualized by root-to-leaf paths. Experiments over real-world benchmark {XML} corpora show that the effectiveness of the three approaches improves with contextualized n-grams of suitable length. This confirms the validity of the devised method from multiple clustering perspectives. Two approaches overcome in effectiveness several state-of-the-art competitors.
