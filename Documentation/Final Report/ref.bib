	abstract = {Multimedia programming environments are intuitive and easy to use for even the non-programmer. However, the textual scripting languages of these environments are difficult to use and require programming experience to code significant functionality. We pro pose a visual scripting language to help bridge the usability gap between the multimedia programming environment and its scripting language by cognitively simplifying the scripting task. Visual programming languages can be easier and faster to program in than textual languages, and visual code can be easier to understand. We explore our hypothesis by designing a multimedia programming environment with a visual scripting language.},

	abstract = {A new method is proposed for clustering XML documents by structure-constrained phrases. It is implemented by three machine-learning approaches previously unexplored in the XML domain, namely non-negative matrix (tri-)factorization, co-clustering and automatic transactional clustering. A novel class of XML features approximately captures structure-constrained phrases as n-grams contextualized by root-to-leaf paths. Experiments over real-world benchmark XML corpora show that the effectiveness of the three approaches improves with contextualized n-grams of suitable length. This confirms the validity of the devised method from multiple clustering perspectives. Two approaches overcome in effectiveness several state-of-the-art competitors. The scalability of the three approaches is investigated, too.},

	abstract = {The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is becoming the de facto standard for software analysis and design modeling. However, there is still significant resistance to model-driven development in many software organizations because it is perceived to be expensive and not necessarily cost-effective. Hence, it is important to investigate the benefits obtained from modeling. As a first step in this direction, this paper reports on controlled experiments, spanning two locations, that investigate the impact of UML documentation on software maintenance. Results show that, for complex tasks and past a certain learning curve, the availability of UML documentation may result in significant improvements in the functional correctness of changes as well as the quality of their design. However, there does not seem to be any saving of time. For simpler tasks, the time needed to update the UML documentation may be substantial compared with the potential benefits, thus motivating the need for UML tools with better support for software maintenance.

The next phase of telecommunications is a major power shift that will fall into a category called personalization, and will be marked by a virtual explosion of innovation. The first of the new personal communications devices BNR envisages is Orbitor, a pocket-sized, mobile communications product concept that integrates voice, messaging, and graphical capabilities. Because Orbitor is a window on a system - revealing everything that system has to offer in ways that are idiosyncratic to the user - it will satisfy the fundamental user values of profound simplicity, conspicuous value, self-evidence, access, real-time interaction, mobility, and control. Personalization is a category that will also become synonymous with personal decisions and personal choices.},
