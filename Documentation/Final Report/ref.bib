	abstract = {Multimedia programming environments are intuitive and easy to use for even the non-programmer. However, the textual scripting languages of these environments are difficult to use and require programming experience to code significant functionality. We pro pose a visual scripting language to help bridge the usability gap between the multimedia programming environment and its scripting language by cognitively simplifying the scripting task. Visual programming languages can be easier and faster to program in than textual languages, and visual code can be easier to understand. We explore our hypothesis by designing a multimedia programming environment with a visual scripting language.},

	abstract = {A new method is proposed for clustering XML documents by structure-constrained phrases. It is implemented by three machine-learning approaches previously unexplored in the XML domain, namely non-negative matrix (tri-)factorization, co-clustering and automatic transactional clustering. A novel class of XML features approximately captures structure-constrained phrases as n-grams contextualized by root-to-leaf paths. Experiments over real-world benchmark XML corpora show that the effectiveness of the three approaches improves with contextualized n-grams of suitable length. This confirms the validity of the devised method from multiple clustering perspectives. Two approaches overcome in effectiveness several state-of-the-art competitors. The scalability of the three approaches is investigated, too.},

	abstract = {The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is becoming the de facto standard for software analysis and design modeling. However, there is still significant resistance to model-driven development in many software organizations because it is perceived to be expensive and not necessarily cost-effective. Hence, it is important to investigate the benefits obtained from modeling. As a first step in this direction, this paper reports on controlled experiments, spanning two locations, that investigate the impact of UML documentation on software maintenance. Results show that, for complex tasks and past a certain learning curve, the availability of UML documentation may result in significant improvements in the functional correctness of changes as well as the quality of their design. However, there does not seem to be any saving of time. For simpler tasks, the time needed to update the UML documentation may be substantial compared with the potential benefits, thus motivating the need for UML tools with better support for software maintenance.

The next phase of telecommunications is a major power shift that will fall into a category called personalization, and will be marked by a virtual explosion of innovation. The first of the new personal communications devices BNR envisages is Orbitor, a pocket-sized, mobile communications product concept that integrates voice, messaging, and graphical capabilities. Because Orbitor is a window on a system - revealing everything that system has to offer in ways that are idiosyncratic to the user - it will satisfy the fundamental user values of profound simplicity, conspicuous value, self-evidence, access, real-time interaction, mobility, and control. Personalization is a category that will also become synonymous with personal decisions and personal choices.},

Generally, at the end of the development phase, there is not enough time or money left to enhance the usability of software. After the user interface has been developed, the users are left alone to handle any problems with the interface. Systematic development using engineering processes can help to overcome these usability problems. This article introduces a structured Useware engineering process, the application of which enhances user orientation which leads to higher acceptance and more practical user interfaces. The article finds that the current process is supported by various expert development tools for the production of user interfaces; these tools ensure a systematic and continuous data transferability from one phase to the next. The process has already provided remarkable results in the area of task orientation and usability within several different industrial sectors, e.g. medicine, manufacturing industry and process engineering. Further possibilities to apply this process are software for online catalog planning or lending and return machines.},

Although a few seminal ideas and instruments have been available for assessing qualities of qualitative research, they have either remained the same or have made little progress. There are several ongoing issues regarding the evaluation of qualitative research, including (1) the fact that there is little agreement on the nature of evaluation in qualitative research, (2) the continuous impact of traditional positivist evaluation criteria on qualitative research, and (3) the broad political discourse on the politics of evidence. This chapter presents a series of definitions regarding evaluation, quality, standards, and excellence, and it discusses major evaluation concepts.},

	abstract = {Personalized computer-based tutoring demands learning systems and applications that identify and keep personal characteristics and features for each individual learner. This is achieved by the technology of student modeling. One prevalent technique of student modeling is stereotypes. Furthermore, individuals differ in how they learn. So, the way that helps an individual to learn best is crucial for offering her/him an effective tutoring experience. As a consequence, students' preferable styles of learning should be incorporated into the student model. However, some researchers have concluded that there are individuals that have a mixture of learning styles. That is the reason for the combination of two different learning style models in the presented approach. Particularly, in this paper we present a stereotype student model that combines the Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing and Kinesthetic (VARK) learning style model and the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI). The aim of this article is to further enhance the personalization to students' needs and preferences by introducing this hybrid instrument and using the technology of stereotypes. The gain from this hybrid learning style approach is that we model two different dimensions of the way that a student prefers to learn: i) the sensory modalities of learning and ii) the way of thinking. In this way, the offered tutoring process can be more tailored to each individual student's needs, respecting the distinct pace of her/his learning. Our novel approach has been incorporated in an e-learning system and was evaluated by 60 undergraduate students in Greece. The evaluation results show a great acceptance rate of the novel hybrid learning style model by students and underline its pedagogical potential.},

This author proposes to test the feasibility of eye-tracking technology in identifying learning styles with everyday materials, as well as the identification accuracy. This author selected the Felder-Silverman's learning style model (FSLSM) as the framework, enlisted the behaviour patterns that can be used to identify the eight learning styles in the FSLSM model, and conducted a quasi-experiment to test whether these behaviour patterns apply to eye movement differences. Then, this author compared the results of eye-tracking identification with participants' self-report based on Index of Learning Style (ILS) questionnaire for identification accuracy. This quasi-experiment recruited 30 university students, including 19 female and 11 male. Findings showed that eye-tracking technology has the potential to quickly identify learners of different types categorised by the FSLSM theory, with accuracy ranging from 63.50\% to 84.67\%; however, there are disturbing factors contributing to different levels of identification accuracy, which should be investigated in future research.},

In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in visual categorization applications, such as object recognition, image classification, and human action recognition.},

Our findings are that the probability that code without initial tests will ever get covered by unit tests is very low. Only the existence of unit tests ensures testability of the code under test. Besides finding defects unit tests also ensure modular design, which is the base for reuse, maintainability and testability.

The study found that the majority of software firms have been adopting traditional software development methodologies accounting to 72\% of 79 studied software products. Specifically, amongst 51 software products developed using traditional software methodology, nearly half of the software products adopted waterfall model. Moreover, agile methodologies and other iterative methods are rarely adopted in the software industry. The implications of the results are discussed.},

Rapid feedback on circuit characteristics is used to evaluate deep architectural changes in short time, greatly reducing the time-to-market with respect to hand-made designs. In addition, our approach is highly flexible, since the same generic high-level description can be used to produce an entire set of circuits, each with different area/performance trade-offs. Thanks to the proposed approach, any change to the initial specification (e.g., the curve used) is also very fast, while it may require a large effort in the case of hand-made designs.},

Specifically, the model is designed to facilitate rapid and incremental delivery and increased quality and efficiency. Method: The refined iterative development model is based on an analysis of models from across a range of industries. The analysis was designed to clearly define what a development model is, the basic phases it contains, and various common uses. The approach to this project was from the perspective of a practicing technical communication professional and project manager. Results: The analysis revealed that development models are visual, conceptual, representational, process-oriented, inventive, and both sequential and iterative. The basic phases common to development models are, generally speaking, Discovery, Planning, Implementation, Review, Refinement, and Release (or Deployment). Common uses include sharing knowledge, facilitating success, enhancing credibility, and demonstrating progress. Conclusion: The analysis and comparison allows for a deeper understanding of what a development model is and how a refined iterative development model can be used to improve processes related to information development. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

	abstract = {In a variety of software development methods and their models of the activity process, no one does not have testing activities in their application. System testing is the last phase of testing that done by the developer in the internal work- space. However, phase of testing is not the end of the whole testing phase, since there is another stage to pass before the product deployment process, it is the acceptance testing. A popular method to perform the user acceptance testing is the usability testing, which in this method, the result provides the indication of the essential quality for the client to decide whether to approve or to deny the product. In this research of paper, we are going to do the usability testing by utilizing the System Usability Scale technique and the Net Promoter Score technique to measure appropriateness of the population information systems in the city of Tegal while we are also finding optimum testers required using the sampling technique. The result we earn trough this research is according to the Usability Testing result the proposed system developed by researchers is better than the current running system and the total testers participating on system testing is able to optimize using the sampling method.},

	abstract = {Hundreds of thousands of Web designers and developers have relied on usability guru Steve Krug's guide to understand the principles of intuitive navigation and information design. Witty, commonsensical, and eminently practical, it's one of the best loved and most recommended books on the subject. It's a core foundational book that every Web designer must internalize to make their designs truly effective. In this substantially revised edition, Steve returns with fresh perspective to reconsider the principles he originally laid out--commenting, amending, amplifying, and offering fresh new examples to underscore their importance. This edition adds an important new chapter on mobile as well as integrating coverage of mobile throughout.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICSTW.2017.65},
	abstract = {Usability is a critical aspect of software systems because poor user experience can lead users to choose other software. One way to improve usability is through testing. But, usability testing is a challenge because, most of the times, it can not be accomplished without the presence of real users, which is complex and requires a lot of effort. However, there are some aspects and usability guidelines that can be tested automatically. This paper presents a test approach that defines generic test strategies (test patterns) to test usability guidelines (or best practices). It is an extension to previous work on testing functional aspects of web applications through the GUI (PBGT – Pattern Based GUI Testing). The main goal of this work is to be the first step in extending PBGT's PARADIGM language with usability testing patterns, so that it is possible to build test models from which usability tests can be generated and automatically executed over a website. This paper presents a new usability test pattern, called "Reachability Test Pattern", which is validated in a case study performed over an academic software system available on the web.},

	abstract = {Voice user interfaces (VUI) have been increasingly used in everyday settings and they are growing in popularity. These interfaces have predominantly eyes-free and hands-free interactions. This kind of experiences continues to be an inceptive field compared to other input methods such as touch or using the keyboard/mouse. Thus, it is important to identify tools used to evaluate the usability of VUIs. This article presents a systematic review, in which we analyzed 57 articles and describes nine questionnaires used for evaluating the usability of VUIs, assessing the potential suitability of these questionnaires to measure different types of interactions and various usability dimensions. We found that these questionnaires were used to evaluate the usability of voice-only and voice-added VUIs: AttrakDiff, ICF-US, MOS-X, SUISQ-R, SUS, SASSI, UEQ, PARADISE and USE, where the SUS questionnaire is the most commonly used. However, its items do not directly assess voice quality, although it evaluates the general user interaction with a system. All the questionnaires include items related to three usability dimensions (effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction). The questionnaire with the most homogeneous coverage regarding the number of items in each aspect of usability is the SASSI questionnaire. It is a normal practice to use multiple questionnaires to obtain a more complete measurement of usability. We perceive the necessity to increase usability research about the differences between the voice interaction with diverse display types (voice-first, voice-only, voice-added) and the dialog types (command-based and conversational), and how usability affects the user expectations about the VUIs.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, with advances in software technologies, the importance of achieving non-functional (quality) requirements, is increasingly growing. One of these requirements is usability. Considering direct user interaction with user interface, high quality of interface, plays an important role in increasing user satisfaction. For this purpose, software user interface must have the suitable usability. To achieve this, some actions have been always done to evaluate the software usability. The quantitative evaluation of qualitative concepts such as usability has been always associated with many challenges. In this paper, a fuzzy expert system has been developed for quantitative evaluation of usability and also increasing the detection of problems and deficiencies in interface design. This system, evaluates usability quantitatively, and by detecting design problems and deficiencies, designers can correct and eliminate them easily.},
